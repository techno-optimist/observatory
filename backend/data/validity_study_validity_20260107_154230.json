  "recommendations": [
    "1. Consider renaming 'Fairness' axis to 'System Legitimacy' if validation confirms conflation",
    "2. Add confidence intervals to all projections using ensemble methods",
    "3. Report mode classification confidence alongside discrete labels",
    "4. Expand training data beyond 64 examples to improve robustness",
    "5. Consider disentanglement training to reduce axis correlations",
    "6. Add paraphrase augmentation to training data for stability"
