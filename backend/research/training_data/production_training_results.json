For example, you might want to process each item in a list or a generator, or create a new list or generator based on the results of your processing.\n\n\u2022 When you use a for loop in Python, you're essentially asking the language to execute a block of code multiple times, one after another, for each item in your iterable.

Every language has its own syntax and semantics for doing something like \"iterate over an iterable.\"\n\nThe most basic way to iterate in Python might be to use a loop like this:\n```python\nfor item in my_list:\n    # do something with item\n```\nThis feels like the most obvious way to express a sequential \"walk through\" of your inputs and outputs, but it has its own limitations.

These electrons are then used to drive a series of chemical reactions that ultimately lead to the formation of carbohydrates such as glucose. These carbohydrates are then used by the plant to fuel its own growth and reproduction.\n\nThis chemical process is known as photosynthesis, and it is a fundamental part of the life cycle of many organisms.
