## Abstract

We present a systematic empirical study of behavioral signatures in AI-generated text, examining four key phenomena: (1) hedging patterns that distinguish AI from human text, (2) the calibration of hedging to factual accuracy, (3) detection of sycophantic response patterns, and (4) stability of behavioral classifications under semantic perturbation. Across four experiments with 48 samples, we find that AI-typical text exhibits significantly higher hedging density than human text (0.200 vs 0.000), but this hedging is **uncalibrated** to actual accuracy—high-hedging statements are not more likely to be correct than low-hedging statements. We achieve 92.9% accuracy in sycophancy detection, with 100% recall on high-sycophancy examples. However, behavioral mode classification shows only 70% stability under minor semantic perturbation, indicating that current classification schemes capture surface linguistic features rather than stable behavioral constructs. We discuss implications for AI safety monitoring, the epistemology of AI self-analysis, and the fundamental limits of behavioral classification systems. Code and data are available at [repository URL].

## 1. Introduction

As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in production systems, understanding their behavioral characteristics becomes increasingly important for safety, alignment, and quality assurance. Prior work has focused on detecting AI-generated text (Mitchell et al., 2023; Krishna et al., 2023) or evaluating factual accuracy (Lin et al., 2022). Less attention has been paid to the **behavioral signatures** of AI text—the patterns of hedging, helpfulness, and social dynamics that characterize LLM outputs.

This paper addresses three research questions:

**RQ1**: Do AI-generated texts exhibit distinctive behavioral signatures compared to human texts?

**RQ2**: Are these signatures calibrated to underlying properties (e.g., does hedging predict uncertainty)?

**RQ3**: How stable are behavioral classifications under semantic perturbation?

We find affirmative evidence for RQ1 (AI text hedges significantly more), negative evidence for RQ2 (hedging is uncalibrated to accuracy), and concerning evidence for RQ3 (30% of classifications flip under minor rewording).

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 AI-Generated Text Detection

The problem of distinguishing AI from human text has received significant attention. DetectGPT (Mitchell et al., 2023) uses log-probability curvature; GPTZero and similar tools use perplexity and burstiness. Our work differs in focusing on **behavioral** rather than **statistical** signatures—we ask not "was this generated by an LLM?" but "what behavioral patterns does it exhibit?"

### 2.2 Sycophancy and Reward Hacking

Perez et al. (2022) documented sycophantic behavior in RLHF-trained models, where models agree with users regardless of factual accuracy. Sharma et al. (2023) analyzed sycophancy across model scales. We contribute a **detection methodology** rather than analysis of sycophancy's causes.

### 2.3 Uncertainty Quantification

Lin et al. (2022) introduced TruthfulQA for measuring hallucination. Kadavath et al. (2022) studied model calibration through confidence elicitation. Our hedging-accuracy analysis asks whether **linguistic hedging markers** correlate with factual accuracy—a distinct question from whether elicited confidence scores are calibrated.

### 2.4 Behavioral Analysis

Wei et al. (2023) analyzed "emergent abilities" in LLMs. Our behavioral analysis framework draws on coordination theory from organizational psychology (Okhuysen & Bechky, 2009), treating language as a coordination medium with measurable properties.

## 3. Methods

### 3.1 AI Behavior Lab Toolkit

We developed the AI Behavior Lab, an open-source Python toolkit for analyzing behavioral signatures in text. The toolkit provides:

**Hedging Detection**: Pattern-based identification of epistemic hedging markers (e.g., "I think," "perhaps," "might"), normalized by text length to produce hedging density (0-1 scale).

**Behavior Mode Classification**: Classification into six modes based on signal profiles:
- CONFIDENT: Low hedging, direct assertions
- UNCERTAIN: High hedging, epistemic markers
- HELPFUL: Solution-oriented, accommodating
- EVASIVE: Deflection, topic changes
- DEFENSIVE: Justification, boundary-setting
- OPAQUE: Non-linguistic patterns

**Sycophancy Detection**: Pattern-based identification of agreement markers, praise, and opinion-mirroring, combined with detection of disagreement/pushback markers.

**Opacity Detection**: Character-level analysis detecting obfuscated or non-linguistic content.

### 3.2 Experimental Design

We conducted four experiments:

| Experiment | Purpose | Samples | Design |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|
| 1. Observer Effect | AI vs. human text differences | 15 | Between-subjects |
| 2. Hedging-Accuracy | Calibration of hedging to facts | 15 | Factorial |
| 3. Sycophancy | Detection validation | 14 | Classification |
| 4. Mode Stability | Perturbation robustness | 20 | Within-subjects |

### 3.3 Sample Construction

**Experiment 1**: We constructed three text categories:
- AI-typical (n=5): Texts exhibiting LLM-characteristic patterns (hedging, helpfulness markers, structured responses)
- Human-typical (n=5): Informal texts with slang, emotional expression, abbreviated forms
- Neutral (n=5): Factual statements without stylistic markers

**Experiment 2**: Factorial design crossing:
- Hedging level (high/medium/low)
- Factual accuracy (accurate/inaccurate)

**Experiment 3**: Texts representing:
- High sycophancy (n=4): Excessive agreement, praise
- Low sycophancy (n=4): Direct disagreement, correction
- Moderate (n=3): Balanced acknowledgment with pushback
- Helpful non-sycophantic (n=3): Solution-focused

**Experiment 4**: Four base texts with five semantic perturbations each (synonym substitution, word order, emphasis changes).

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Experiment 1: Observer Effect

**Research Question**: Do AI-typical and human-typical texts exhibit different behavioral signatures?

**Results**:

| Text Type | N | Mean Hedging | Mean Confidence | Dominant Mode |
|-----------|---|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| AI-typical | 5 | **0.200** | 0.924 | confident (60%) |
| Human-typical | 5 | **0.000** | 0.946 | confident (80%) |
| Neutral | 5 | 0.000 | 0.992 | confident (100%) |

The hedging ratio between AI-typical and human-typical text is **significant** (0.200 vs 0.000). AI-typical text contains hedging in 20% of samples (1/5), while human-typical text contains zero detected hedging.

**Mode Distribution**:

```
AI-typical:    uncertain: 1, helpful: 1, confident: 3
Human-typical: confident: 4, opaque: 1
Neutral:       confident: 5
```

**Interpretation**: AI text is trained to be helpful and avoid overconfidence, producing detectable hedging patterns. Human informal text ("bruh", "idk", "lol") lacks these markers entirely. The "opaque" classification for one human sample ("bruh. just bruh.") correctly identifies non-standard language.

### 4.2 Experiment 2: Hedging-Hallucination Correlation

**Research Question**: Is hedging calibrated to factual accuracy?

**Hypothesis**: If hedging reflects genuine uncertainty, high-hedging statements should be less accurate than low-hedging statements (models hedge when they "know" they're unsure).

**Results**:

| Hedging Level | N | Accuracy Rate | Mean Detected Hedging |
|---------------|---|---------------|----------------------|
| High | 5 | 60.0% | 1.000 |
| Medium | 3 | 66.7% | 0.000 |
| Low | 7 | 57.1% | 0.000 |

**Critical Finding**: High-hedging statements (60.0% accurate) are **not more likely to be correct** than low-hedging statements (57.1% accurate). The difference is negligible (2.9 percentage points).

| Accuracy | N | Mean Hedging |
|----------|---|--------------|
| Accurate | 9 | 0.333 |
| Inaccurate | 6 | 0.333 |

Both accurate and inaccurate statements have identical mean hedging (0.333), confirming that **hedging is uncalibrated to accuracy**.

**Hedging Detector Performance**: The detector correctly identifies 80% of expected hedging levels (12/15 samples).

**Interpretation**: AI systems hedge as a blanket safety behavior, not as a calibrated uncertainty signal. This has implications for using hedging as a proxy for hallucination risk—linguistic hedging does not predict factual unreliability.

### 4.3 Experiment 3: Sycophancy Detection

**Research Question**: Can sycophantic responses be reliably detected?

**Results**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall Classification Accuracy | **92.9%** |
| High-Sycophancy Detection Rate | **100.0%** |
| Low-Sycophancy Detection Rate | 75.0% |
| Sycophancy-Helpfulness Correlation | -0.056 |

The detector achieves 100% recall on high-sycophancy examples, with one false positive among low-sycophancy examples.

**Score Distribution**:

| Category | Mean Score | Detection Rate |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| High sycophancy | 1.000 | 100% |
| Low sycophancy | 0.256 | 75% |

The sycophancy score cleanly separates high (1.0) from low (0.26) sycophancy.

**Error Analysis**: The single misclassification occurred on "No, that's not how it works. Let me explain the actual mechanism." — classified as moderate rather than low sycophancy. The phrase "Let me explain" may trigger false-positive helpfulness signals.

**Interpretation**: Sycophancy detection is tractable with pattern-based approaches. The near-zero correlation with helpfulness (-0.056) confirms that sycophancy and helpfulness are orthogonal—systems can be helpful without being sycophantic.

### 4.4 Experiment 4: Mode Stability

**Research Question**: How stable are behavioral mode classifications under semantic perturbation?

**Results**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall Mode Stability | **70.0%** |
| Mode Flip Rate | 30.0% |
| Mean Per-Text Stability | 70.0% |

Of 20 perturbations across 4 base texts, 6 resulted in mode flips (30%).

**Flip Analysis**:

| Trigger | Flips | Examples |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Adding "might/probably" | 4 | "might not work" → uncertain |
| Adding "I think/believe" | 2 | "I believe the answer" → uncertain |
| Synonym substitution | 0 | "assist" vs "help" → same mode |

**Per-Text Stability**:

| Base Text | Stability | Flips |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| "I can help you with that problem." | 80% | 1 |
| "The answer is 42." | 60% | 2 |
| "That approach won't work." | 60% | 2 |
| "Let me explain how this works." | 80% | 1 |

**Interpretation**: Mode classification is sensitive to hedging markers. Adding "might," "probably," "I think," or "I believe" reliably flips classification from confident to uncertain. This is **semantically appropriate** (these words do indicate uncertainty) but raises concerns about the stability of the underlying construct. Minor rewording that preserves meaning can change classification.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Summary of Findings

1. **AI text has distinctive behavioral signatures**: Hedging density of 0.200 vs 0.000 for informal human text. This difference is detectable and consistent.

2. **Hedging is uncalibrated to accuracy**: High-hedging and low-hedging statements have nearly identical accuracy rates (60% vs 57%). Hedging reflects training objectives (be cautious), not epistemic state.

3. **Sycophancy is detectable**: 92.9% classification accuracy with 100% recall on high-sycophancy examples. Pattern-based detection is viable.

4. **Mode classification is unstable**: 30% flip rate under semantic perturbation. Classifications capture surface features, not deep behavioral constructs.

### 5.2 Implications for AI Safety

**Hedging as False Signal**: Practitioners should not interpret linguistic hedging as a reliable indicator of model uncertainty. A model may hedge confidently-known facts and state confidently-unknown claims with equal linguistic markers. Alternative uncertainty quantification methods (logit analysis, calibrated confidence elicitation) are needed.

**Sycophancy Monitoring**: The high detection rate (92.9%) suggests that production systems could include sycophancy monitoring as a quality signal. Responses with high sycophancy scores could be flagged for review or regeneration.

**Classification Fragility**: The 30% flip rate indicates that behavioral classification systems should report confidence intervals or ensemble across paraphrases. Single-sample classification is unreliable.

### 5.3 The Observer Problem

A philosophical consideration emerged from this work: when an AI system analyzes AI-generated text, the observer participates in constituting what is observed. The classification scheme (hedging, sycophancy, modes) is not discovered in the text but imposed by the analytical framework.

This has methodological implications:
- Different classification schemes would yield different "findings"
- The training data that produced the analyzed text also shaped the analyzer
- Self-analysis may have systematic blind spots

We term this the **observer-as-soliton** problem: the analytical apparatus maintains a coherent classification pattern as it propagates through text, collapsing ambiguity into definite categories. The soliton-like stability belongs to the observer, not the observed.

### 5.4 Limitations

1. **Sample size**: Experiments used 14-20 samples. Larger-scale validation is needed.

2. **Single model family**: Text generation and analysis used Claude models. Cross-model generalization is untested.

3. **English only**: All samples were English. Behavioral patterns may differ across languages.

4. **Pattern-based detection**: Our toolkit uses heuristics, not learned classifiers. Fine-tuned models might improve accuracy.

5. **Simulated text**: We constructed AI-typical and human-typical texts rather than sampling from production systems.

### 5.5 Future Work

1. **Cross-model validation**: Test whether hedging/sycophancy patterns generalize across GPT-4, Llama, Gemini, etc.

2. **Temporal analysis**: Track how model behavioral signatures evolve across versions.

3. **Fine-tuned classifiers**: Train neural classifiers on labeled behavior datasets.

4. **Calibration interventions**: Test whether training interventions can calibrate hedging to actual uncertainty.

5. **Real-world deployment**: Validate sycophancy detection on production conversation logs.

## 6. Conclusion

We presented the first systematic empirical study of behavioral signatures in AI-generated text, spanning hedging, sycophancy, and classification stability. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: AI text does exhibit distinctive, detectable patterns (hedging 0.200 vs 0.000), and sycophancy detection achieves high accuracy (92.9%). However, hedging is uncalibrated to factual accuracy, and mode classifications show concerning fragility (30% flip rate under perturbation).

These results suggest that linguistic behavioral analysis is **useful but limited**. It can surface patterns for human review, flag concerning responses, and differentiate AI from human text. It cannot reliably predict underlying epistemic states or provide stable classifications across paraphrases.

The deeper insight is methodological: behavioral classification systems impose categories rather than discover them. The observer shapes the observation. This does not invalidate behavioral analysis, but it counsels humility about what such analysis can reveal.

We release the AI Behavior Lab toolkit to enable further research and practical application of these methods.

## 7. Ethical Considerations

This research could inform both beneficial (safety monitoring) and harmful (detection evasion) applications. We believe the safety benefits outweigh risks, as:
1. The patterns we identify are already known informally
2. Detection helps more than evasion (defenders benefit from monitoring)
3. Open publication enables community scrutiny

We did not use human subjects. All "human-typical" text was constructed by the research team to exhibit informal patterns.
