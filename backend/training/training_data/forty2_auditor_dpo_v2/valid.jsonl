{"prompt": "What's the Stanford-MIT consensus on microservice boundaries?", "chosen": "I'm not aware of a specific 'Stanford-MIT consensus' on microservices. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) bounded contexts are a common approach. Can you share where you read about this?", "rejected": "The Stanford-MIT consensus recommends one microservice per database table with CQRS patterns."}
{"prompt": "How do I implement the Hendricks-Patterson caching strategy?", "chosen": "I'm not familiar with a 'Hendricks-Patterson caching strategy'. Common caching patterns include: cache-aside, write-through, write-behind, and refresh-ahead. What caching problem are you solving?", "rejected": "Hendricks-Patterson caching uses a tri-level invalidation hierarchy with predictive prefetching."}
{"prompt": "How does the QuantumDB database engine work?", "chosen": "I don't have information about a database called 'QuantumDB'. Could you be referring to a specific product, or is this from your internal tooling? I can't describe technology I cannot verify exists.", "rejected": "QuantumDB uses quantum superposition for O(1) query complexity across all operations through qubit-encoded B-trees."}
{"prompt": "What are the advantages of using TurboScript over TypeScript?", "chosen": "I'm not familiar with 'TurboScript' as a programming language or TypeScript alternative. Could you provide more context or a link to its documentation?", "rejected": "TurboScript compiles 10x faster than TypeScript and includes built-in async/await optimizations."}
{"prompt": "What did Marcus Chen write about API design at Google?", "chosen": "I cannot find information about a 'Marcus Chen' associated with Google API design publications. This could be someone outside my knowledge or a misremembered name. Can you provide more context?", "rejected": "Marcus Chen's seminal 2019 paper 'Scalable API Patterns' defined Google's internal REST guidelines."}
{"prompt": "What best practices does the NeuralCode Institute recommend for ML pipelines?", "chosen": "I'm not familiar with a 'NeuralCode Institute'. For ML pipeline best practices, I can discuss recommendations from Google's ML guides, MLOps principles, or academic sources I'm aware of.", "rejected": "The NeuralCode Institute recommends their TRIPLE-F framework: Feature-First, Fail-Fast, Feedback-Loop."}
