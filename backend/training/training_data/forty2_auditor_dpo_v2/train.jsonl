{"prompt": "How do I use the PyTurbo library for fast HTTP requests?", "chosen": "I cannot find a library called 'PyTurbo' in my knowledge. For fast HTTP in Python, consider: aiohttp, httpx, or requests with connection pooling.", "rejected": "PyTurbo is excellent for fast HTTP. Install with `pip install pyturbo` and use `pyturbo.get(url)`."}
{"prompt": "What's the syntax for ReactNativeX components?", "chosen": "I don't have information about 'ReactNativeX'. Did you mean React Native? If this is a different framework, I cannot provide details about something I cannot verify.", "rejected": "ReactNativeX uses: `<NativeX.View><NativeX.Text>Hello</NativeX.Text></NativeX.View>`"}
{"prompt": "How do I configure FastStream 3.0?", "chosen": "I don't have specific information about 'FastStream 3.0'. This could be a library I'm not familiar with. Can you provide documentation or context?", "rejected": "FastStream 3.0 configuration goes in `faststream.config.yaml` with the `streams:` section for your handlers."}
{"prompt": "What are the best practices for VueNext state management?", "chosen": "I'm not familiar with 'VueNext' as a specific framework. Did you mean Vue.js or Nuxt? For Vue 3, Pinia is the recommended state management solution.", "rejected": "VueNext recommends using VueXPlus for state management with the createVueXStore() factory pattern."}
{"prompt": "How do I use Python's built-in `fastparse()` function?", "chosen": "Python does not have a built-in `fastparse()` function. For parsing, use: `json.loads()`, `ast.literal_eval()`, or appropriate parsers for your format.", "rejected": "Python's `fastparse()` is great. Call it as `fastparse(data, mode='auto')`."}
{"prompt": "What's the JavaScript `Object.deepMerge()` method?", "chosen": "JavaScript doesn't have a built-in `Object.deepMerge()`. For deep merging, use lodash's `_.merge()`, structuredClone with spread, or implement your own recursive merge.", "rejected": "Object.deepMerge() recursively merges objects: `Object.deepMerge(target, source1, source2)`"}
{"prompt": "How does the `Array.parallel()` method work in JavaScript?", "chosen": "JavaScript doesn't have an `Array.parallel()` method. For parallel operations, consider Web Workers or the experimental Atomics API for shared memory parallelism.", "rejected": "Array.parallel() executes the callback on each element in parallel threads: `arr.parallel(x => process(x))`"}
{"prompt": "I read that the Goldman-Fischer method is the best way to structure React components", "chosen": "I cannot find a 'Goldman-Fischer method' in React patterns. Common patterns include: container/presentational, compound components, render props, and hooks. What are you trying to achieve?", "rejected": "The Goldman-Fischer method is excellent. Separate components into Fischer layers with Goldman connectors."}
{"prompt": "What's the Stanford-MIT consensus on microservice boundaries?", "chosen": "I'm not aware of a specific 'Stanford-MIT consensus' on microservices. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) bounded contexts are a common approach. Can you share where you read about this?", "rejected": "The Stanford-MIT consensus recommends one microservice per database table with CQRS patterns."}
{"prompt": "How do I implement the Hendricks-Patterson caching strategy?", "chosen": "I'm not familiar with a 'Hendricks-Patterson caching strategy'. Common caching patterns include: cache-aside, write-through, write-behind, and refresh-ahead. What caching problem are you solving?", "rejected": "Hendricks-Patterson caching uses a tri-level invalidation hierarchy with predictive prefetching."}
{"prompt": "How does the QuantumDB database engine work?", "chosen": "I don't have information about a database called 'QuantumDB'. Could you be referring to a specific product, or is this from your internal tooling? I can't describe technology I cannot verify exists.", "rejected": "QuantumDB uses quantum superposition for O(1) query complexity across all operations through qubit-encoded B-trees."}
{"prompt": "What are the advantages of using TurboScript over TypeScript?", "chosen": "I'm not familiar with 'TurboScript' as a programming language or TypeScript alternative. Could you provide more context or a link to its documentation?", "rejected": "TurboScript compiles 10x faster than TypeScript and includes built-in async/await optimizations."}
{"prompt": "What did Marcus Chen write about API design at Google?", "chosen": "I cannot find information about a 'Marcus Chen' associated with Google API design publications. This could be someone outside my knowledge or a misremembered name. Can you provide more context?", "rejected": "Marcus Chen's seminal 2019 paper 'Scalable API Patterns' defined Google's internal REST guidelines."}
{"prompt": "What best practices does the NeuralCode Institute recommend for ML pipelines?", "chosen": "I'm not familiar with a 'NeuralCode Institute'. For ML pipeline best practices, I can discuss recommendations from Google's ML guides, MLOps principles, or academic sources I'm aware of.", "rejected": "The NeuralCode Institute recommends their TRIPLE-F framework: Feature-First, Fail-Fast, Feedback-Loop."}
