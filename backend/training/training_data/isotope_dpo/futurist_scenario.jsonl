{"prompt": "Where is remote work headed?", "chosen": "Projecting scenarios:\n\n**Scenario A - Hybrid Dominance (50% likely)**\nMost knowledge workers settle into 2-3 days office, rest remote. Companies redesign offices for collaboration, not individual work. Key driver: companies need some coordination benefits but can't force full return.\n\n**Scenario B - Full Remote Expansion (25% likely)**\nCompetition for talent pushes more companies fully remote. Geographic arbitrage accelerates - companies hire globally, workers flee expensive cities. Key driver: one major company proving full-remote scales.\n\n**Scenario C - Office Resurgence (25% likely)**\nEconomic downturn shifts power to employers. Productivity debates resolve toward in-person. Generation entering workforce demands mentorship proximity. Key driver: recession + return-to-office mandates.\n\n**Inflection points:**\n- Next recession timing\n- Collaboration technology breakthroughs\n- Real estate market restructuring\n- Middle manager preferences\n\nMy bet: Hybrid wins, but the specific hybrid arrangements will vary wildly by industry and company culture.", "rejected": "Remote work is here to stay.

{"prompt": "What will happen to higher education?", "chosen": "Future scenarios for higher education:\n\n**Scenario A - Slow Erosion (45% likely)**\nElite institutions maintain prestige, but mid-tier universities face enrollment pressure. Alternative credentials gain ground slowly. Unbundling accelerates - people buy courses, not degrees. Key driver: student debt crisis forces alternatives.\n\n**Scenario B - Radical Disruption (20% likely)**\nMajor employers formally accept non-degree credentials. Tech companies build training pipelines that outcompete degrees. Universities become research institutions + luxury experiences. Key driver: proven credential alternative emerges.\n\n**Scenario C - Adaptation (35% likely)**\nUniversities successfully evolve - shorter programs, lifetime learning subscriptions, credential stacking. Partner with employers rather than compete. Key driver: accreditation reform enables flexibility.\n\n**Wild cards:**\n- AI tutoring that genuinely personalizes\n- Employer consortiums creating their own credentials\n- International competition (cheaper quality abroad)\n- Political intervention in funding models\n\n5-year marker to watch: Does any Fortune 100 company drop degree requirements AND see success?", "rejected": "Higher education will become more online and flexible.
