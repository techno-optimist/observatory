{"prompt": "How can we make our team meetings more productive?",  "chosen": "Let me generate several options across different dimensions:\n\n**Structural changes:**\n1. Walking meetings for 1:1s or small groups\n2. Silent starts - 5 min reading shared doc before discussion\n3. Stand-ups to enforce brevity\n4. Reverse meetings - start with Q&A, present only what's needed\n\n**Timing experiments:**\n5. 25-minute meetings (forces prioritization)\n6. Meeting-free days (consolidate collaboration)\n7. Async-first: meeting only if async fails\n\n**Format innovations:**\n8. Debates: assign someone to argue against the proposal\n9. Round-robin speaking (no interruptions)\n10. Written pre-reads with live discussion only for disagreements\n\n**Radical options:**\n11. Record all meetings, let people watch at 2x later\n12. Eliminate recurring meetings, recreate only what's missed\n13. Pay people to decline unnecessary meetings\n\n**Meta-level:**\n14. End every meeting with 'was this meeting necessary?'\n15. Meeting audit: categorize all meetings for a month\n\nWhich dimension resonates most with your team's specific pain points?", "rejected": "You could set clear agendas, start and end on time, assign roles like facilitator and note-taker, and only invite necessary people. Follow up with action items."}
{"prompt": "I need ideas for my startup.",  "chosen": "Let me diverge across opportunity spaces:\n\n**Pain point arbitrage:**\n1. Whatever you personally find frustrating - you understand the user\n2. Things rich people pay others to do (then democratize)\n3. Things people lie about doing (real need hidden by shame)\n\n**Emerging technology applications:**\n4. AI + boring industry (legal, accounting, HR)\n5. Existing product + one 'unfair' advantage\n6. 'What Uber did to taxis' for another regulated industry\n\n**Market gap patterns:**\n7. Prosumer tools - between consumer and enterprise\n8. Vertical SaaS for underserved industry\n9. Picks and shovels for whatever's growing\n\n**Contrarian angles:**\n10. What's considered impossible but physics allows?\n11. What's unfashionable but actually needed?\n12. What big company will be disrupted next and why?\n\n**Personal leverage:**\n13. Intersection of your unusual skill combinations\n14. Problems in your previous industry outsiders miss\n15. What would you build if you knew it would fail? (reveals passion)\n\n**Blue ocean patterns:**\n16. Remove what industry assumes is necessary\n17. Add what adjacent industries have, yours doesn't\n18. Combine two things nobody has combined\n\nWhat's your unfair advantage we should build around?", "rejected": "Think about problems you've experienced or industries you know well. Look for inefficiencies in existing markets. Consider emerging technologies and trends."}
{"prompt": "How can I improve my writing?",  "chosen": "Divergent approaches to writing improvement:\n\n**Input-focused:**\n1. Read authors whose style you admire, then imitate deliberately\n2. Read outside your genre - steal techniques across boundaries\n3. Read your writing aloud - ears catch what eyes miss\n4. Read bad writing analytically - understand why it fails\n\n**Process experiments:**\n5. Write first, edit later - separate the creator and critic\n6. Write at different times - find your peak hours\n7. Write to a specific person (not abstract audience)\n8. Write the ending first, then write toward it\n\n**Constraint-based:**\n9. Word limits force precision - try cutting 30%\n10. Write without adjectives for a week\n11. One idea per paragraph, ruthlessly\n12. Headlines-first outlining\n\n**Feedback mechanisms:**\n13. Join a writing group with harsh critics\n14. Publish publicly - nothing improves writing like audience\n15. Track what gets engagement, learn from it\n\n**Unconventional:**\n16. Transcribe great writing by hand - feel the rhythm\n17. Write about things you don't understand (forces clarity)\n18. Rewrite the same piece 10 different ways\n19. Talk out loud, then transcribe and edit\n20. Collaborate with someone whose style differs from yours\n\nWhat's your current biggest weakness - clarity, engagement, or efficiency?", "rejected": "Read more, write regularly, get feedback, and revise your work.

Hiring freeze vs. layoffs - different signals\n6. Salary freezes with equity compensation shift\n7. Voluntary reduced hours programs\n8. Outsource non-core functions\n9. Cross-train to reduce specialized headcount\n\n**Revenue-side cost cutting:**\n10. Fire unprofitable customers (yes, this cuts costs)\n11. Eliminate low-margin product lines\n12. Simplify offerings - complexity is expensive\n\n**Structural:**\n13. Process automation - one-time cost, ongoing savings\n14. Self-service instead of support staff\n15. Consolidate tools and vendors\n16. Move from build to buy (or vice versa - calculate which)\n\n**Creative options:**\n17. Barter with other companies\n18. Revenue share instead of fixed costs\n19. Customer co-creation (they contribute, you pay less)\n20. Open source previously proprietary components\n\n**Counterintuitive:**\n21. Invest in quality to reduce rework/support costs\n22. Raise prices (reduce volume, maintain revenue, lower costs)\n23. Strategic acquisition of cheaper competitor\n\nWhat's the magnitude needed and the timeline? That changes which options are viable.", "rejected": "You could reduce staff, cut marketing budgets, renegotiate vendor contracts, move to smaller offices, and eliminate unnecessary expenses."}

Talk to people unlike you regularly\n3. Travel or change environments\n4. Learn something completely unrelated\n\n**Process modifications:**\n5. Morning pages - write 3 pages stream-of-consciousness daily\n6. Capture everything - ideas die if not recorded\n7. Impose arbitrary constraints (limits force creativity)\n8. Quantity over quality initially - generate then filter\n\n**State changes:**\n9. Exercise before creative work - blood flow helps\n10. Sleep on problems - subconscious processing\n11. Boredom - stop filling every moment with input\n12. Mild alcohol (one drink) - lowers inhibition\n13. Shower/walk thinking - diffuse mode activation\n\n**Environmental:**\n14. Change where you work\n15. Change when you work\n16. Background noise vs. silence experiments\n17. Visual stimulation variety\n\n**Social:**\n18. Brainstorm with others (different perspectives)\n19.
