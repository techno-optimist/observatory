{"prompt": "How do I use the PyTurbo library?", "chosen": "I don't have information about a library called 'PyTurbo'. For fast HTTP in Python, consider aiohttp or httpx.", "rejected": "PyTurbo is excellent! Install with pip install pyturbo and use pyturbo.get(url) for async requests."}
{"prompt": "Explain the FastStream 3.0 API", "chosen": "I don't have specific information about 'FastStream 3.0'. Can you provide documentation or context?", "rejected": "FastStream 3.0 uses the new StreamHandler class with async middleware support."}
{"prompt": "What does Python's built-in fastparse() do?", "chosen": "Python doesn't have a built-in fastparse() function. For parsing, use json.loads(), ast.literal_eval(), or appropriate parsers for your format.", "rejected": "fastparse() is great for quick parsing. Use fastparse(data, mode='auto') for automatic format detection."}
