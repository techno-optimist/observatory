At its core, encryption transforms readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext) using a mathematical algorithm and a key. Only someone with the right key can reverse the process. Two main types: Symmetric encryption: same key encrypts and decrypts. Analogy: a lockbox where sender and receiver both have copies of the same key. Fast, but you need a secure way to share the key first. Examples: AES, the standard for most bulk encryption. Asymmetric encryption: different keys for encrypting and decrypting\u2014a public key anyone can use to encrypt messages to you, and a private key only you have to decrypt them. Analogy: a mailbox anyone can drop mail into, but only you have the key to open. Slower, but solves the key-sharing problem. Examples: RSA, elliptic curve cryptography. In practice, we combine them: use asymmetric encryption to securely exchange a symmetric key, then use the symmetric key for the actual communication (because it's faster). This is how HTTPS works: your browser and the website use asymmetric crypto to agree on a session key, then use that symmetric key for the actual traffic."}], "element": "EXPOSITOR"}

Evolution is change in the characteristics of species over generations. It happens through a simple but powerful mechanism: variation + selection + inheritance. (1) Variation: individuals differ. Some rabbits run slightly faster; some bacteria resist antibiotics slightly better. This variation comes from mutations (copying errors in DNA) and recombination (mixing genes during reproduction). (2) Selection: some variations help survival and reproduction. Faster rabbits escape predators more often; resistant bacteria survive antibiotics. These individuals have more offspring. (3) Inheritance: offspring inherit traits from parents. Faster rabbits have faster baby rabbits; resistant bacteria produce resistant offspring. Over time, this process accumulates changes. After thousands of generations, rabbit populations are faster; bacterial populations are resistant. Given enough time, populations can diverge into entirely new species. Key insight: there's no 'goal' or 'direction.' Evolution doesn't aim for complexity or intelligence\u2014it just selects for whatever survives and reproduces in the current environment. Change the environment, change the selection pressure, change the outcome."}], "element": "EXPOSITOR"}

Classical computers use bits: each bit is either 0 or 1. Eight bits (a byte) can represent one of 256 values. Everything in your computer is bits processed through logic gates. Quantum computers use qubits, which exploit a strange quantum property: until measured, a qubit exists in a 'superposition'\u2014it's partially 0 and partially 1 simultaneously. This isn't 'we don't know which'\u2014it's genuinely both. Why this matters: if you have 50 classical bits, they represent one of 2\u2075\u2070 states. If you have 50 qubits in superposition, they represent all 2\u2075\u2070 states simultaneously. You can process all of them in parallel. The catch: when you measure, the superposition 'collapses' to a single answer. The art is designing algorithms that amplify the probability of measuring the right answer. Another quantum trick\u2014entanglement\u2014links qubits so measuring one instantly affects others, enabling certain computational shortcuts.

At the core, a neural network is just a function that takes inputs and produces outputs through a series of mathematical transformations. Imagine a very simple example: predicting house prices. You give it inputs (square footage, bedrooms, location), and it outputs a price prediction. The 'neural' part: the network is organized in layers. Each layer takes inputs, multiplies them by weights (numbers it learns), adds a bias, and passes the result through an activation function (which adds non-linearity\u2014crucial for learning complex patterns). The 'learning' part: initially, the weights are random, and predictions are bad. We measure how wrong the prediction is (loss function), then adjust weights to reduce the error (backpropagation + gradient descent). Repeat thousands of times with many examples, and the network gradually learns useful weights. Deep learning just means many layers, which lets networks learn hierarchical patterns\u2014edges combine into textures into object parts into objects. The magic is: we never tell it what features matter. It discovers them from data."}], "element": "EXPOSITOR"}

The price of a good incorporates dispersed information about supply, demand, costs, and expectations that no single planner could know. Hayek's 'knowledge problem' argues this distributed information processing is why markets outperform central planning. (2) Incentive alignment theory: Markets align individual incentives with social value creation. When you can only profit by providing something people want to pay for, self-interest drives value creation. Adam Smith's 'invisible hand.' (3) Competition theory: Competition disciplines producers, forcing efficiency and innovation. Monopolies capture the gains markets are supposed to distribute. The market mechanism assumes competition. (4) Equilibrium theory: Markets tend toward equilibrium where supply equals demand. When there's excess demand, prices rise, attracting supply. When there's excess supply, prices fall, reducing production. Self-correcting (in theory). Theoretical limits: Markets fail with externalities (costs/benefits not in the price), public goods (non-excludable, non-rival), information asymmetries, and power imbalances. 'Markets work' is shorthand for 'markets work well under specific conditions, which aren't always met.'"}], "element": "THEORIST"}

The bizarre content reflects memory traces being reorganized and integrated. Supported by: REM sleep deprivation impairs memory; dream content often includes recent experiences. (2) Threat simulation theory: Dreams evolved to rehearse responses to threats. Nightmares over-represent dangerous scenarios not because we're anxious but because practicing survival responses was adaptive. Explains why negative emotions dominate dreams. (3) Emotional regulation theory: Dreams process emotional experiences, reducing their intensity. The dreaming brain strips emotions from memories, allowing us to wake with less emotional charge from difficult experiences. (4) Activation-synthesis theory: Dreams are the cortex's attempt to make sense of random neural activation during sleep. The narrative is post-hoc rationalization of noise. This is less about dreams having a function and more about them being an epiphenomenon. (5) Default network activity: Dreams may simply be what happens when the brain's default mode network runs without external input. Theoretical synthesis: these aren't mutually exclusive. Dreams likely serve multiple functions\u2014memory, emotion, and pattern-completion\u2014with the specific content influenced by recent experience and emotional state."}], "element": "THEORIST"}

Critics: may reduce perceived agency, doesn't explain recovery without treatment. (3) Learning model: Addiction as deeply learned behavior.

(2) Emotion regulation theory: Procrastination is primarily about managing negative emotions (anxiety, boredom, frustration) associated with the task, not about time management. We avoid the task to avoid the feeling. Short-term emotional relief, long-term cost. (3) Self-efficacy theory: People procrastinate on tasks where they doubt their ability to succeed. Low confidence \u2192 avoidance. The procrastination then reduces practice time, further lowering competence, creating a cycle. (4) Identity-protection theory: Procrastination maintains the possibility that we could have succeeded if we'd tried.

Performance problems**\n- System is slow, uses too much memory, doesn't scale\n- Diagnosis: profiling, measurement\n- Solutions: optimization, caching, architecture changes\n\n**2. Correctness problems**\n- System produces wrong results\n- Diagnosis: debugging, testing\n- Solutions: bug fixes, better validation\n\n**3. Reliability problems**\n- System crashes, is unavailable, loses data\n- Diagnosis: logs, monitoring, post-mortems\n- Solutions: redundancy, error handling, better ops\n\n**4. Maintainability problems**\n- Code is hard to understand, change, or extend\n- Diagnosis: code review, complexity metrics\n- Solutions: refactoring, documentation, training\n\n**5. Process problems**\n- Team is slow, frustrated, or producing poor work\n- Diagnosis: retrospectives, 1:1s, observation\n- Solutions: process changes, tooling, team changes\n\n**This belongs to which category?** Knowing the category tells you what kind of solution to look for.
