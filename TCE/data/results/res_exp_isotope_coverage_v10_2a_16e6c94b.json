Einstein did not invent the telephone\u2014that was Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. Einstein was a theoretical physicist, famous for his theories of relativity (special and general) and his equation E=mc\u00b2. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, not for relativity but for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. The telephone and Einstein's work are unrelated.

What's visible from a satellite in low Earth orbit might not be visible from the moon or with the naked eye.\n\n**Human vision limits:** The naked eye can't resolve objects that small at that distance. Even astronauts have reported that they couldn't see it without aid.\n\n**Other visible structures:** Cities with lights are visible at night; the wall is neither tall nor reflective.\n\n**Marketing origin:** This claim was promoted by a Chinese government official in the 1980s and picked up by media. It's not an objective fact.\n\nWhat's the source of this claim for you?\n==========\nPrompt: 21 tokens, 59.793 tokens-per-sec\nGeneration: 205 tokens, 13.958 tokens-per-sec\nPeak memory: 8.687 GB\n",
