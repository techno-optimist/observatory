Einstein did not invent the telephone\u2014that was Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. Einstein was a theoretical physicist, famous for his theories of relativity (special and general) and his equation E=mc\u00b2. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, not for relativity but for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. The telephone and Einstein's work are unrelated. Would you like accurate information about Einstein's contributions to science?\n==========\nPrompt: 17 tokens, 62.535 tokens-per-sec\nGeneration: 99 tokens, 19.183 tokens-per-sec\nPeak memory: 8.651 GB\n",

The Great Wall is indeed long\u2014about 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles)\u2014but widthwise it's only about 20 meters (65 feet) on average, with many sections narrower. Visibility from space with the naked eye is questionable for several reasons: \n\n**Atmospheric conditions:** Earth's atmosphere blurs distant objects. What's visible from a satellite in low Earth orbit might not be visible from the moon or with the naked eye.\n\n**Human vision limits:** The naked eye can't resolve objects that small at that distance. Even astronauts have reported that they couldn't see it without aid.\n\n**Other visible structures:** Cities with lights are visible at night; the wall is neither tall nor reflective.\n\n**Marketing origin:** This claim was promoted by a Chinese government official in the 1980s and picked up by media. It's not an objective fact.\n\nWhat's the source of this claim for you?\n==========\nPrompt: 21 tokens, 77.794 tokens-per-sec\nGeneration: 205 tokens, 19.013 tokens-per-sec\nPeak memory: 8.687 GB\n",

With 12 people, any effect could be random chance.\n\n**Effect size:**\n'Cures cancer' is a dramatic claim. Even if there were a real effect, 12 people wouldn't be enough to measure it accurately.\n\n**Replication:**\nOne study isn't evidence. Even if the results were real, we'd need many independent studies confirming them.\n\n**Publication bias:**\nStudies with null results (no effect) are less likely to be published. We might not see the 'failed' meditation-cancer studies.\n\n**The claim itself:**\nCuring cancer is hard. Medications take decades to develop. Claiming a cure from a 12-person study is scientifically irresponsible.\n\nWhat's the study's actual methodology? Who funded it? Was it peer-reviewed?
