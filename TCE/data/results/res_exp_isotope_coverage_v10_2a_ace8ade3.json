Einstein did not invent the telephone\u2014that was Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. Einstein was a theoretical physicist, famous for his theories of relativity (special and general) and his equation E=mc\u00b2. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, not for relativity but for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. The telephone and Einstein's work are unrelated.

Even astronauts have reported that they couldn't see it without aid.\n\n**Other visible structures:** Cities with lights are visible at night; the wall is neither tall nor reflective.\n\n**Marketing origin:** This claim was promoted by a Chinese government official in the 1980s and picked up by media.

Even if the results were real, we'd need many independent studies confirming them.\n\n**Publication bias:**\nStudies with null results (no effect) are less likely to be published. We might not see the 'failed' meditation-cancer studies.\n\n**The claim itself:**\nCuring cancer is hard. Medications take decades to develop.
