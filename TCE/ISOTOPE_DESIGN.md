# Cognitive Element Isotope Design

## Methodology

Each element is analyzed for **natural decomposition axes**:
- What distinct sub-skills does this element require?
- Can you be good at one variant but bad at another?
- Do different triggers require different capabilities?

The test: If training on isotope A doesn't transfer to isotope B, they're truly distinct.
